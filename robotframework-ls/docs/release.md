Steps to do a new release
---------------------------

- Open a shell at the proper place (something as `X:\vscode-robot\robotframework-lsp\robotframework-ls`)

- Create release branch (`git branch -D release-robotframework-lsp&git checkout -b release-robotframework-lsp`)

- Update version (`python -m dev set-version 0.41.0`).

- Update README.md to add notes on features/fixes (on `robotframework-ls` and `robotframework-intellij`).

- Update changelog.md to add notes on features/fixes and set release date (on `robotframework-ls` and `robotframework-intellij`).

- Update build.gradle version and patchPluginXml.changeNotes with the latest changelog (html expected).

- Push contents, get the build in https://github.com/robocorp/robotframework-lsp/actions and install locally to test.

- Rebase with master (`git checkout master&git rebase release-robotframework-lsp`).

- Create a tag (`git tag robotframework-lsp-0.41.0`) and push it.
