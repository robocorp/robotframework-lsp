## Robocorp VS Code extension

The Robocorp extension makes it easy to create Python based automation projects and AI Actions.

You can use this extension as part of the [Robocorp Automation Stack](https://github.com/robocorp/rcc), which has been optimized for Python Automation and creating AI actions. It scales up from simple image fetching or API calling all the way to complex process enterprise automation workflows.

Main features include:

-   **Create, run and debug AI Actions** - Robocorp AI Actions provide end-to-end stack supporting every type of connection between AI and your apps and data. You are in control where to run the code and everything is built for easiness, security, and scalability. 

-   **Automatic configuration of dependencies** - Every Python oriented project uses its own lightweight virtual environment and runs in isolation.

-   **Inspector for Web, Windows Application Elements & more** - Pick elements from different mediums and create locators for automation

-   **Create, run and debug projects** - Do these with ease while developing Tasks to automate applications

-   **Deploy projects to Robocorp Control Room** - Run unattended automation in a safe, reliable and easy to use Cloud Platform.

> Note: the use of cloud-based orchestration in [Robocorp Control Room](https://cloud.robocorp.com/) requires a free account.

    - Validation for [package.yaml](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp/blob/master/action_server/docs/guides/01-package-yaml.md).
-   Support for [Robo](https://github.com/robocorp/robocorp) (Robocorp's Python Framework for automation).
    -   Ctrl+Click on terminal for the 'Robocorp html Log` opens external browser.
    -   Code Lenses to `Run Task` / `Debug Task` for tasks decorated with `@task`.
    -   `ROBO TASKS OUTPUT` which shows the output of tasks run with `@task`.

-   Verify Robot for inconsistencies with `Robocorp: Robot Configuration Diagnostics` action.
-   Create a terminal with a Robot environment through the `Robocorp: Terminal with Task Package (Robot) environment` action.
-   Run a Robot with the `Robocorp: Run Task Package (Robot)` action.
-   Debug a Robot with the `Robocorp: Debug Task Package (Robot)` action. - It's possible to debug plain Python tasks using the Python extension or Robot Framework tasks using the Robot Framework Language Server (in which case the task must start with `python -m robot` and finish with the folder/filename to be run).
-   When a [robot.yaml](https://robocorp.com/docs/setup/robot-yaml-format) is found, it utilises the related Python environment when running/debugging `.robot` files using the RobotFramework Language Server.
-   Set the pythonPath configuration to get code completion in the Python extension through the `Set pythonPath based on robot.yaml` action.
-   View, launch and debug Robots from the `Robots` view.
