  output.


New in 1.5.0 (2023-07-06)
-----------------------------

- Fixed issues in `Run Task` / `Debug Task` (launching `robocorp.tasks`):
    - Robot environment properly used when robot is available.

- Faster Startup (after a successful startup, cached information is used so that subsequent startups are faster).
- When specifying the timeout for the vault, the token is guaranteed to have that as the minimum value (in previous versions it could reuse it for `75%` of the time, so, a `2h` timeout request could return a `0:30h` minutes token).
    - Timeout limits are now in place so that the minimum timeout is 5 minutes and maximum is 1 hour (but the token requested may be a bit higher so that the extension can cache it and reuse it for more time).
    - Note: if a longer timeout is needed for testing, a managed environment such as `Robocorp Control Room` or `Robocorp Assistant` is recommended.

  - Only the last 5 runs are kept in the output. To keep older items, rename the folder or move it to `devdata/work-items-in`.
  - For previously existing items, those should be moved to `devdata/work-items-in` so that they are shown.
  - Changing `env.json` should not be needed anymore (in fact, changes to the related variables will be ignored to avoid clashes with other tools).
