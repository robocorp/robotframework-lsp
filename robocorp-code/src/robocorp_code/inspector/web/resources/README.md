The files in this folder can be regenerated by cloning:

`robocorp/inspector-ext`

And running: `npm run build`.
This will produce files in `dist` folder.

The resource files needed for Browser Automation are found in `dist/browserTS`.
Copy all those files here - here is `robotframework-lsp/robocorp-code/src/robocorp_code/inspector/web/resources`.

You are DONE! ðŸš€
