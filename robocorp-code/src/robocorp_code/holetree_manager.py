"""
The main reason for this class is managing the space name for holotrees.

The design is the following:

When a space name is requested, we collect/store the metadata based on the
request and then provide a space name based on what was previously requested
and the current request.

Note that there are a number of heuristics done to make sure that the request
is Ok.

Also, the space name is just a part of the info needed as after a name
is requested, we also need to consider that the environment isn't really
valid until the environment was actually created for the given space.

The structure goes as follows:

Each request for a space name creates a structure in the disk such as:

/vscode-01.lock     Lock file used, needed to write contents and generate the env.
/vscode-01          The directory name as well as the space name.
    /time           The last time that this space name was used.
    /conda.yaml     The contents used for the space name.
    /conda_path     The path to the conda file last used for this env.
    /state          The current state name.
                    It's contents are one of:
                       'created'
                       'environment_requested'
                       'environment_ready'
                    Depending on the current state of the space.
    /env.json       A Json with the environment for this space.
                    Note that it's created later on, after the environment
                    is actually created.
    /damaged        Written if the space is to be considered damaged
                    and should be reclaimed after a timeout.
